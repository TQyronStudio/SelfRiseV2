## Phase 2: Premium Themes & Customization 🎨

### Goal
Unlock exclusive visual themes as gamification rewards

### Phase 2.1: T-Qyron Theme (Level 20 Unlock) 👑

**Implementation Priority**: Medium (after base theme system complete)
**Complexity**: Low (extends existing theme infrastructure)
**Prerequisites**: Theme system (Context API) implemented, Gamification level tracking

#### Checkpoint 2.1.1: T-Qyron Theme Design & Implementation
**Goal**: Create premium unlockable theme as level-based achievement reward

##### Features:
- [ ] Design T-Qyron color palette (premium/exclusive visual identity)
- [ ] Implement theme unlock logic based on user level (≥20)
- [ ] Create "Theme Locked" state in Settings with level requirement display
- [ ] Add unlock celebration modal when user reaches Level 20
- [ ] Create theme preview system (locked themes show preview but can't be activated)
- [ ] Add achievement/trophy for unlocking T-Qyron theme
- [ ] Implement theme badge/indicator in Settings menu

**Technical Implementation**:
```typescript
// Theme system will check gamification level
interface ThemeOption {
  id: 'light' | 'dark' | 'system' | 'tqyron';
  name: string;
  unlockLevel?: number;        // undefined = always unlocked
  badge?: string;              // Display badge (e.g., '👑' for premium)
  preview: ThemeColors;        // Preview palette for locked themes
}

const themes: ThemeOption[] = [
  { id: 'light', name: 'Light', preview: lightColors },
  { id: 'dark', name: 'Dark', preview: darkColors },
  { id: 'system', name: 'System Auto', preview: lightColors },
  {
    id: 'tqyron',
    name: 'T-Qyron',
    unlockLevel: 20,
    badge: '👑',
    preview: tqyronColors
  },
];

// In ThemeSelector component:
const { level } = useGamification();
const isUnlocked = !theme.unlockLevel || level >= theme.unlockLevel;
```

**User Experience Flow**:
1. User at Level 5 opens Settings → Sees "T-Qyron 👑" theme with lock icon
2. Taps locked theme → Modal shows: "Reach Level 20 to unlock T-Qyron theme!"
3. User reaches Level 20 → Achievement unlocked modal: "🎉 T-Qyron Theme Unlocked!"
4. Settings now shows T-Qyron as selectable option
5. User activates T-Qyron → App transforms with premium color palette

**Gamification Integration**:
- Achievement unlock: "Style Master - Unlock your first premium theme"
- XP bonus on first activation: +500 XP
- Social sharing: "I just unlocked the exclusive T-Qyron theme! 👑"
- Retention impact: Premium theme acts as status symbol and engagement anchor

**Future Expansion Potential**:
- Level 50: "Midnight Galaxy" theme 🌌
- Level 100: "Golden Champion" theme ✨
- Special event themes: Holiday seasonal themes (Christmas, Halloween)
- Achievements-based themes: "Complete 100-day streak to unlock Aurora theme"

**Design Considerations**:
- **T-Qyron color palette TBD** - Will be designed when implementing this feature
  - Options to consider: gold/luxury vibe, cyber/futuristic aesthetic, or custom brand colors
  - Must maintain accessibility standards (WCAG contrast ratios)
  - Should feel meaningfully different from light/dark (premium experience)
  - Visual elements that emphasize exclusivity (subtle animations, premium icons)
- **Note**: Color palette design postponed until Phase 2.1 implementation begins

## Phase 3: Data Export & Backup System 💾

**Moved from Checkpoint 7.2 - postponed to focus on Theme + Language first**

**Priority**: Medium | **Complexity**: Medium | **Estimated**: 4-6 hours

**Goal**: Allow users to export, backup, and restore all their app data for safety and portability

### Features:
- [ ] Export All Data - Download complete backup as JSON file
- [ ] Import Backup - Restore data from backup file
- [ ] Storage Usage Display - Show data size breakdown by category
- [ ] Auto Backup Toggle - Automatic weekly backups
- [ ] Share exported backup across apps (email, cloud storage)

**Technical Implementation**:
- ✅ Backup/restore logic already complete: `src/services/storage/backup.ts`
- ✅ UserSettings type includes `dataBackupEnabled` flag
- ⏳ Need to install: `expo-sharing`, `expo-document-picker`, `expo-file-system`
- ⏳ Need to create: DataExportModal component
- ⏳ Need to integrate: Share API and DocumentPicker for native file operations

**Export Format**:
- File extension: `.selfrise.json`
- Includes: Habits, Goals, Journal, XP data, Achievements, User Settings
- Metadata: Timestamp, app version, migration version, item counts

**User Flow**:
1. User taps "Export Data" → App creates JSON backup
2. Native share sheet opens → User can send via email, save to iCloud/Google Drive
3. User taps "Import Backup" → File picker opens
4. User selects `.selfrise.json` file → Confirmation modal warns about overwrite
5. User confirms → Data restored, success message shown

**Why postponed**:
- Theme and Language are higher priority for user experience
- Export/Backup is "safety net" feature - important but not urgent
- Requires additional native dependencies and testing

**When to implement**:
- After Checkpoint 7.2 (Theme + Language) complete
- Before Phase 10 (App Store launch) - users need backup before going live
