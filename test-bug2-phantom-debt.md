# 🧪 BUG #2 PHANTOM DEBT AFTER AUTO-RESET - COMPREHENSIVE TEST SCENARIOS

## **OVERVIEW**
Testing the enhanced auto-reset state tracking system to ensure phantom debt is completely eliminated after auto-reset occurs.

## **CRITICAL SCENARIOS TO VALIDATE**

### **🎯 SCENARIO 1: Basic Auto-Reset Prevention**
**Objective**: Verify no phantom debt appears after auto-reset

**Test Steps**:
1. User accumulates 5+ missed days → triggers auto-reset
2. Verify streak = 0, debtDays = 0, autoResetTimestamp = recent
3. User attempts to write journal entry → should be allowed
4. NO "pay debt" message should appear
5. NO debt warning should show in My Journal

**Expected Result**: ✅ Entry creation allowed immediately after auto-reset

---

### **🎯 SCENARIO 2: calculateDebt() Auto-Reset Respect**
**Objective**: Verify calculateDebt() returns 0 after auto-reset

**Test Steps**:
1. Simulate auto-reset state with autoResetTimestamp = now
2. Call `gratitudeStorage.calculateDebt()` directly
3. Should return 0 regardless of actual missed entries in storage
4. Verify debug logs show "Auto-reset X.X hours ago. Debt = 0"

**Expected Result**: ✅ calculateDebt() returns 0 for 24h after auto-reset

---

### **🎯 SCENARIO 3: Multi-Source Debt Validation**
**Objective**: Test authoritative vs calculated debt consistency

**Test Steps**:
1. Create state: streak.debtDays = 0, but raw missed days = 5
2. GratitudeInput should use streak.debtDays as primary source
3. Verify entry creation is allowed (no blocking)
4. Check logs for discrepancy warnings

**Expected Result**: ✅ Authoritative source (streak.debtDays) takes precedence

---

### **🎯 SCENARIO 4: Auto-Reset Timestamp Cleanup**
**Objective**: Verify old auto-reset timestamps are cleaned up

**Test Steps**:
1. Set autoResetTimestamp to 25 hours ago
2. Call calculateDebt() 
3. Should clear old timestamp and proceed with normal calculation
4. Verify timestamp is set to null after cleanup

**Expected Result**: ✅ Old timestamps (>24h) automatically cleared

---

### **🎯 SCENARIO 5: Force Reset Phantom Debt Prevention**
**Objective**: Test force reset also prevents phantom debt

**Test Steps**:
1. User has debt → uses "Force Reset Debt" option
2. Verify autoResetTimestamp is set with reason "Force reset by user action"  
3. Attempt entry creation → should be allowed
4. calculateDebt() should return 0

**Expected Result**: ✅ Force reset also triggers phantom debt prevention

---

### **🎯 SCENARIO 6: Cross-Screen State Consistency**
**Objective**: Verify auto-reset state is consistent across Home and My Journal

**Test Steps**:
1. Auto-reset occurs (5+ days debt)
2. Home screen: streak = 0, no debt warning displayed
3. My Journal screen: entry creation allowed, no debt blocking
4. Navigate between screens → state remains consistent

**Expected Result**: ✅ No phantom debt warnings on any screen

---

### **🎯 SCENARIO 7: Edge Case - Today Completion Override**
**Objective**: Test today completion works correctly after auto-reset

**Test Steps**:
1. Auto-reset occurs (user had 5 missed days)
2. User writes 3+ entries today  
3. calculateDebt() should return 0 (today completion override)
4. No debt should accumulate despite previous missed days

**Expected Result**: ✅ Today completion clears any residual debt calculation

---

### **🎯 SCENARIO 8: Debug Logging & Monitoring**
**Objective**: Verify comprehensive logging for debugging

**Test Steps**:
1. Trigger auto-reset scenario
2. Check logs for:
   - Auto-reset timestamp setting
   - calculateDebt() auto-reset detection  
   - GratitudeInput authoritative source usage
   - Consistency discrepancy warnings
3. Verify all debug info is sufficient for troubleshooting

**Expected Result**: ✅ Complete audit trail for phantom debt debugging

---

## **TECHNICAL VALIDATION POINTS**

### **🔧 State Consistency**
- [ ] `streak.debtDays` matches `calculateDebt()` result after auto-reset
- [ ] `autoResetTimestamp` properly persists across app restarts
- [ ] No discrepancies between authoritative and calculated debt
- [ ] Modal systems receive consistent debt state

### **🔧 Auto-Reset Tracking**
- [ ] `autoResetTimestamp` set during both auto-reset and force reset
- [ ] `autoResetReason` provides meaningful debugging information
- [ ] 24-hour validity window works correctly
- [ ] Old timestamps properly cleaned up

### **🔧 Entry Creation Logic**
- [ ] GratitudeInput uses authoritative source correctly
- [ ] No false positives blocking entry creation
- [ ] Bonus entries allowed when appropriate
- [ ] Error messages use "Rescue Streak" terminology

---

## **REGRESSION PREVENTION**

### **🛡️ Scenarios That Should NOT Happen**
1. **No Phantom Debt**: After auto-reset, NO debt warnings should appear
2. **No Entry Blocking**: Users with streak = 0 should NEVER be blocked from writing
3. **No State Inconsistency**: Authoritative and calculated debt should align
4. **No Perpetual Auto-Reset**: Old timestamps should NOT prevent normal debt calculation

### **🛡️ Performance Considerations**
- Auto-reset checks should NOT significantly impact calculateDebt() performance
- Timestamp comparisons should be efficient
- Debug logging should not overwhelm console in production

---

## **SUCCESS CRITERIA**

✅ **Bug #2 RESOLVED**: No phantom debt warnings after auto-reset
✅ **State Consistency**: authoritative_debt = calculated_debt at all times
✅ **User Experience**: Smooth entry creation after streak reset
✅ **Debug Capability**: Complete audit trail for troubleshooting
✅ **Performance**: No significant impact on debt calculation speed

---

## **MANUAL TESTING CHECKLIST**

### **Quick Verification**
1. [ ] Create 5+ day debt → verify auto-reset occurs
2. [ ] After auto-reset, attempt journal entry → should succeed
3. [ ] Check Home screen → no debt warning visible
4. [ ] Check My Journal → no debt blocking occurs
5. [ ] Use force reset → verify same behavior

### **Edge Case Testing**
1. [ ] Test with exactly 4 days debt (should NOT auto-reset)
2. [ ] Test auto-reset on day when user completes today
3. [ ] Test state persistence across app restart
4. [ ] Test old timestamp cleanup after 25+ hours
