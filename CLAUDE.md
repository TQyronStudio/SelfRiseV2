1. First think through the problem, read the codebase for relevant files, and write a plan to projectplan.md.
2. The plan should have a list of todo items that you can check off as you complete them
3. Before you begin working, check in with me and I will verify the plan.
4. Then, begin working on the todo items, marking them as complete as you go.
5. Please every step of the way just give me a high level explanation of what changes you made
6. Make every task and code change you do as simple as possible. We want to avoid making any massive or complex changes. Every change should impact as little code as possible. Everything is about simplicity.
7. Finally, add a review section to the projectplan.md file with a summary of the changes you made and any other relevant information.
8. After you successfully complete any task (like creating a file, installing a dependency, or writing code), your immediate next action MUST be to update the corresponding checkbox in `projectplan.md` to `[x]`. This is a non-negotiable part of the workflow.
9. The `projectplan.md` file is our single source of truth. You are explicitly forbidden from deleting, clearing, or overwriting the entire content of this file without my direct, explicit permission in a prompt. You are only allowed to add to it or check off tasks.
