# Phase 1.1.1: Journal Backup & Verification

## ✅ Status: READY FOR TESTING

## 📋 Overview

Phase 1.1.1 creates a verified backup of all journal data before SQLite migration.

**Files Created:**
- ✅ `/src/services/database/migration/journalBackup.ts` - Backup logic
- ✅ `/src/services/database/migration/testJournalBackup.ts` - Test suite
- ✅ `/src/services/database/migration/runBackupTest.ts` - App integration
- ✅ `/app/(tabs)/migration-test.tsx` - UI test screen

## 🎯 What This Phase Does

1. **Creates Backup**
   - Reads all journal entries from AsyncStorage (`GRATITUDES`)
   - Reads streak data from AsyncStorage (`GRATITUDE_STREAK`)
   - Stores backup in AsyncStorage (`MIGRATION_BACKUP_JOURNAL_V1`)

2. **Verifies Backup**
   - Generates checksums for entries and streak data
   - Compares entry counts (source vs backup)
   - Confirms backup can be retrieved and parsed

3. **Provides Rollback**
   - Can restore from backup if anything goes wrong
   - Verified restoration process

## 📦 Backup Data Structure

```typescript
interface JournalBackup {
  version: string;            // "1.0.0"
  timestamp: number;          // Unix timestamp
  backupDate: string;         // ISO date string

  entries: Gratitude[];       // All journal entries
  streak: GratitudeStreak;    // Streak data

  entriesCount: number;       // Count for verification
  entriesChecksum: string;    // Data integrity check
  streakChecksum: string;     // Streak integrity check

  verified: boolean;          // true if backup passed verification
}
```

## 🧪 How to Test

### Option 1: Using Migration Test Screen (RECOMMENDED)

1. **Open the app** on your iPhone
2. **Navigate to "Migration Test" tab** (wrench icon in bottom nav)
3. **Press "Run Full Test"** button
4. **Check the log** - should show all tests passing

Expected output:
```
✅ ALL TESTS PASSED
📦 Backup Status:
   - Entries backed up: X
   - Streak backed up: Yes
   - Verified: Yes
   - Backup location: AsyncStorage key "MIGRATION_BACKUP_JOURNAL_V1"
```

### Option 2: Manual Function Calls

```typescript
import { runBackupTest } from './src/services/database/migration/runBackupTest';

// Run full test
const result = await runBackupTest();
console.log(result);
// { success: true, message: "Backup test passed!" }
```

## ✅ Success Criteria

- [x] Backup script created
- [x] Test suite created
- [x] Test screen integrated
- [ ] **Test passes on actual app data** ⬅️ YOU ARE HERE
- [ ] Backup verified with checksums
- [ ] Ready to proceed to Phase 1.1.2

## 🚨 Critical Safety Features

1. **Checksum Verification**
   - Detects data corruption
   - Ensures backup integrity

2. **Count Verification**
   - Confirms all entries backed up
   - No data loss

3. **Rollback Capability**
   - Can restore from backup anytime
   - Tested restoration process

4. **Separate Storage Key**
   - Backup stored in `MIGRATION_BACKUP_JOURNAL_V1`
   - Original data never modified during backup

## 🔄 Rollback Instructions

If anything goes wrong AFTER migration starts:

```typescript
import { rollbackFromBackup } from './src/services/database/migration/journalBackup';

const result = await rollbackFromBackup();
// { success: true, restoredEntries: X, restoredStreak: true }
```

## 📍 Backup Location

**AsyncStorage Key:** `MIGRATION_BACKUP_JOURNAL_V1`

**Contains:**
- All journal entries (`GRATITUDES`)
- Streak data (`GRATITUDE_STREAK`)
- Verification checksums
- Metadata

**Size:** Approximately 10-100KB depending on journal entry count

## ⏭️ Next Steps

After this phase passes:

1. ✅ Backup is verified and ready
2. ⏭️ **Proceed to Phase 1.1.2:** SQLite Schema Creation
3. ⏭️ **Phase 1.1.3:** Data Migration to SQLite
4. ⏭️ **Phase 1.1.4:** Verification & Testing
5. ⏭️ **Phase 1.1.5:** Update GratitudeStorage Service

## 🗑️ Cleanup After Migration

**DO NOT DELETE** backup until:
- ✅ Migration is 100% complete
- ✅ All verification tests pass
- ✅ App runs stably for 1-2 weeks

**Then delete:**
- `/app/(tabs)/migration-test.tsx` (test screen)
- AsyncStorage key `MIGRATION_BACKUP_JOURNAL_V1` (backup data)
- This README file

Keep migration scripts for reference/debugging.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Test fails with "Backup not found"
- Run "Create Backup" button first
- Check AsyncStorage is available

### Test fails with "Checksum mismatch"
- Data was modified during backup
- Run backup again

### Test fails with "Count mismatch"
- Entry count changed during backup
- Run backup again in stable state

## 📊 Expected Results

For a typical user:
- **Entries backed up:** 10-100 entries
- **Streak backed up:** Yes (current streak preserved)
- **Verification:** All checksums match
- **Time to backup:** < 1 second
- **Backup size:** ~ 50KB
