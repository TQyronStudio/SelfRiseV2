# SelfRise V2 - Project Plan

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED: Remove Dead Category Cases from UI Components

Successfully cleaned up switch statements in UI components by removing dead category cases that are no longer valid after the AchievementCategory enum was updated.

### Files Updated:
- [x] `/src/components/challenges/MonthlyProgressCalendar.tsx` - Removed 'mastery', 'social', 'special' from getCategoryColor
- [x] `/src/components/challenges/MonthlyChallengeDetailModal.tsx` - Removed 'mastery', 'social', 'special' from getCategoryColor and getCategoryIcon, removed 'mastery' from getMonthlyChallengeTips
- [x] `/src/components/achievements/AchievementDetailModal.tsx` - Removed 'mastery', 'social', 'special' from getCategoryColor and getCategoryIcon

### Remaining Valid Categories:
Only these categories are now supported in the cleaned switch statements:
- `habits` - 'üéØ' - #22C55E / #4CAF50
- `journal` - 'üìù' - #3B82F6 / #2196F3
- `goals` - 'üèÜ' - #F59E0B / #FF9800
- `consistency` - '‚ö°' - #8B5CF6 / #F44336
- `default` case for fallback

All changes maintain proper switch statement structure and functionality.

**Implementation Phases**:

**Phase 1: Basic Notification Infrastructure (MVP)** ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
- [x] Install and configure `expo-notifications` package
- [x] Create NotificationService utility

**Phase 2: Smart Evening Notifications**
- [ ] Create NotificationScheduler service
  - [ ] analyzeUserProgress() - check habits, journal, goals completion status
  - [ ] generateSmartMessage() - create contextual notification text based on missing tasks
- [ ] Implement smart notification logic (priority order):
  1. [ ] Check incomplete habits ‚Üí "Je≈°tƒõ ti chyb√≠ dokonƒçit n√°vyky! üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
  2. [ ] Check journal entries (<3) ‚Üí "Nezapome≈à zapsat 3 z√°znamy do den√≠ku! üìù"
  3. [ ] Check bonus entries (if 3 basic done) ‚Üí "M√°≈° je≈°tƒõ ƒças na bonusov√© z√°znamy! ‚≠ê"
  4. [ ] All complete ‚Üí **No notification** (let user rest, no spam)
- [ ] Hook into app lifecycle
  - [ ] On app open ‚Üí recalculate progress and reschedule evening notification
  - [ ] On task completion (habit/journal) ‚Üí update scheduled notification if needed
- [ ] Handle notification tap

- **Background Processing**: None required - notifications scheduled in advance during app usage
- **Performance Impact**: ~50ms async operation on app launch (non-blocking)
- **Data Source**: AsyncStorage (habits, journal, goals data)
- **Fallback**: If app not opened all day, use generic evening text instead of specific task counts
- **Text Strategy**:
  - Afternoon: Generic motivational (always relevant)
  - Evening: Smart contextual (based on last app open data)

**User Settings**:
```
üì¨ Notifications
‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ
  ‚ö†Ô∏è Notifications disabled ‚Üí [Open System Settings >]

  üåÖ Afternoon Reminder        [üü¢ ON / ‚ö™ OFF]
     üïê Time: 16:00             [Change >]
     üí¨ "Motivational check-in"

  üåô Evening Reminder          [üü¢ ON / ‚ö™ OFF]
     üïê Time: 20:00             [Change >]
     üí¨ "Smart task reminder"
```

**Notification Logic**:

**Afternoon (16:00)** - Generic rotation:
- "Jak ti dnes jde? Nezapome≈à na sv√© c√≠le a n√°vyky! üöÄ"
- "Je≈°tƒõ m√°≈° ƒças! Zkontroluj sv√© n√°vyky a c√≠le üí™"
- "Odpoledn√≠ check-in: Jak pokraƒçuje≈° ve sv√Ωch c√≠lech? üéØ"
- "ƒåas na micro-win! Dokonƒç√≠≈° je≈°tƒõ jeden n√°vyk? üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"

**Evening (20:00)** - Smart priority:
1. **Incomplete habits** (highest priority)
   - "Je≈°tƒõ ti chyb√≠ dokonƒçit n√°vyky! üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
2. **Missing journal entries** (<3 required)
   - "Nezapome≈à zapsat 3 z√°znamy do den√≠ku! üìù"
3. **Missing bonus entries** (if 3 basic done)
   - "M√°≈° je≈°tƒõ ƒças na bonusov√© z√°znamy! ‚≠ê"
4. **All tasks complete**
   - No notification sent (user earned rest)

**Default State**:
- Notifications: **OFF** by default (user opts in)
- Afternoon time: **16:00**
- Evening time: **20:00**

**Notes**:
- Removed streak/achievement notifications (redundant - user sees celebrations immediately in-app)
- Phase 3 (advanced features) intentionally excluded per user request
- Smart notifications update whenever app is opened during the day for maximum accuracy
