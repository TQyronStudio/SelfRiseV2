- **Critical Issues**: 8 journal spam vulnerabilities üö®
- **Excess XP Impact**: +260 XP potential exploitation per day

**üö® CRITICAL SECURITY ISSUE - JOURNAL SPAM PREVENTION BROKEN:**
- **Problem**: GratitudeInput.tsx awards 20 XP for ALL entries (ignores spam prevention)
- **Expected**: Entries 1-3: 20 XP, Entries 4-13: 8 XP, Entries 14+: 0 XP
- **Actual**: All entries get 20 XP (unlimited exploitation possible)
- **Impact**: Users can create unlimited journal entries for 20 XP each
- **Root Cause**: Missing entry count validation in GratitudeInput.tsx:109-111
