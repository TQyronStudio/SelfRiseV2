# SelfRise V2 - Project Plan

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED: Remove Dead Category Cases from UI Components

Successfully cleaned up switch statements in UI components by removing dead category cases that are no longer valid after the AchievementCategory enum was updated.

### Files Updated:
- [x] `/src/components/challenges/MonthlyProgressCalendar.tsx` - Removed 'mastery', 'social', 'special' from getCategoryColor
- [x] `/src/components/challenges/MonthlyChallengeDetailModal.tsx` - Removed 'mastery', 'social', 'special' from getCategoryColor and getCategoryIcon, removed 'mastery' from getMonthlyChallengeTips
- [x] `/src/components/achievements/AchievementDetailModal.tsx` - Removed 'mastery', 'social', 'special' from getCategoryColor and getCategoryIcon

### Remaining Valid Categories:
Only these categories are now supported in the cleaned switch statements:
- `habits` - 'üéØ' - #22C55E / #4CAF50
- `journal` - 'üìù' - #3B82F6 / #2196F3
- `goals` - 'üèÜ' - #F59E0B / #FF9800
- `consistency` - '‚ö°' - #8B5CF6 / #F44336
- `default` case for fallback

All changes maintain proper switch statement structure and functionality.
