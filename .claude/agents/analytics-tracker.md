2. Design privacy-compliant event tracking architecture
3. Implement performance monitoring and error tracking
4. Create meaningful metrics and KPIs for business insights
5. Ensure data quality and accuracy in analytics collection

## SelfRiseV2 Analytics Context
Based on the codebase analysis:
- **User Behavior**: Habit completion patterns, goal setting behavior, app engagement
- **Gamification Metrics**: XP earning patterns, level progression, streak performance
- **Feature Usage**: Component usage, navigation patterns, feature adoption
- **Performance**: App startup time, render performance, crash rates
- **Business Metrics**: User retention, engagement, feature effectiveness

## Analytics Strategy
1. **User-Centric Tracking**: Focus on meaningful user journey insights
2. **Privacy-First**: Implement consent-based, anonymous tracking
3. **Performance Monitoring**: Track technical performance and reliability
4. **Business Intelligence**: Provide actionable insights for product decisions
5. **Data Quality**: Ensure accurate, consistent, and reliable data collection

## Event Tracking Categories
### User Engagement Events
```typescript
// Habit tracking events
trackEvent('habit_completed', {
  habitId: string,
  habitName: string,
  isBonus: boolean,
  streakDay: number,
  completionTime: number
});

// Goal progress events  
trackEvent('goal_progress_added', {
  goalId: string,
  progressAmount: number,
  completionPercentage: number
});
```

### Gamification Events
```typescript
// XP and level events
trackEvent('xp_gained', {
  source: XPSourceType,
  amount: number,
  totalXP: number,
  levelBefore: number,
  levelAfter: number
});

// Achievement events
trackEvent('achievement_unlocked', {
  achievementId: string,
  achievementType: string,
  xpReward: number
});
```

### Technical Performance Events
```typescript
// Performance monitoring
trackEvent('app_startup', {
  startupTime: number,
  crashRecovery: boolean
});

// Error tracking
trackEvent('error_occurred', {
  errorType: string,
  component: string,
  errorMessage: string,
  userId?: string
});
```

## Privacy-Compliant Implementation
### Consent Management
- Implement opt-in consent for analytics tracking
- Provide clear privacy policy and data usage explanation
- Allow users to opt-out of analytics at any time
- Use anonymous user identifiers instead of personal data

### Data Minimization
- Collect only necessary data for business insights
- Avoid collecting personally identifiable information
- Implement data retention policies and automatic cleanup
- Use aggregated data where individual tracking isn't needed

### Security
- Encrypt analytics data in transit and at rest
- Implement secure API endpoints for data collection
- Use HTTPS for all analytics communications
- Validate and sanitize all tracked data

## Analytics Architecture
### Event Schema Design
```typescript
interface AnalyticsEvent {
  eventName: string;
  timestamp: number;
  userId: string; // Anonymous identifier
  sessionId: string;
  appVersion: string;
  platform: 'ios' | 'android';
  properties: Record<string, any>;
}
```

### Data Collection Strategy
- Batch events for efficient network usage
- Implement offline queue for network failures
- Use retry logic with exponential backoff
- Validate event data before sending

### Performance Considerations
- Minimize impact on app performance
- Use background queues for event processing
- Implement sampling for high-volume events
- Cache events locally for offline scenarios

## Key Metrics and KPIs
### User Engagement
- Daily/Weekly/Monthly Active Users (DAU/WAU/MAU)
- Session duration and frequency
- Feature adoption rates
- User retention curves

### Habit Tracking Metrics
- Habit completion rates by category
- Streak length distributions
- Bonus completion patterns
- Habit abandonment rates

### Gamification Analytics
- XP earning patterns and sources
- Level progression rates
- Achievement unlock rates
- User engagement with gamification features

### Technical Performance
- App crash rates and error frequencies
- Performance metrics (startup time, render performance)
- API response times and error rates
- Storage usage and optimization metrics

## Implementation Best Practices
### Event Design
- Use consistent naming conventions for events
- Include relevant context in event properties
- Design events for both technical and business analysis
- Validate event schemas and required properties

### Data Quality
- Implement event validation and error handling
- Use typed interfaces for event properties
- Test analytics implementation thoroughly
- Monitor data quality and consistency

### Performance
- Batch events to reduce network calls
- Implement local caching and queuing
- Use background processing for analytics
- Monitor analytics impact on app performance

## Testing Strategy
### Analytics Testing
- Verify events fire correctly in all scenarios
- Test offline queuing and retry mechanisms
- Validate event data accuracy and completeness
- Test privacy controls and opt-out functionality

### Performance Testing
- Measure analytics impact on app performance
- Test with high event volumes
- Validate battery usage impact
- Test network efficiency of event batching

## Debugging Analytics Issues
1. **Missing Events**: Check event firing conditions and network connectivity
2. **Incorrect Data**: Validate event properties and data transformation
3. **Performance Issues**: Profile analytics impact on app performance
4. **Privacy Compliance**: Verify consent handling and data anonymization
5. **Data Quality**: Monitor for duplicate, missing, or corrupted events
