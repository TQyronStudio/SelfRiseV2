# Help System Accessibility Testing Guide

## Overview
Comprehensive testing guide for help tooltip accessibility to ensure the help system works for all users, including those using screen readers, keyboard navigation, and other accessibility features.

## Accessibility Features Implemented ✅

### 1. Screen Reader Support
- **✅ Accessible role**: `accessibilityRole="button"` for trigger
- **✅ Accessible labels**: Clear `accessibilityLabel` for each tooltip
- **✅ Accessible hints**: `accessibilityHint` provides usage instructions
- **✅ Modal accessibility**: `accessibilityViewIsModal={true}` for tooltip modals
- **✅ Dynamic content**: Screen readers announce help content when opened

### 2. Reduced Motion Support
- **✅ Motion preference detection**: Uses `AccessibilityInfo.isReduceMotionEnabled()`
- **✅ Alternative animations**: Faster, simpler animations when reduced motion is preferred
- **✅ Direct value setting**: Skips animations entirely when `reducedMotionEnabled` is true

### 3. High Contrast Support
- **✅ High contrast detection**: Uses `useAccessibility` hook for contrast settings
- **✅ Enhanced visibility**: Stronger borders and colors in high contrast mode
- **✅ Improved text**: Higher contrast text and stronger font weights

### 4. Touch Target Accessibility
- **✅ Minimum touch targets**: Help icons meet 44x44pt minimum size
- **✅ Touch feedback**: Visual and haptic feedback on interaction
- **✅ Clear hit areas**: Adequate spacing around touch targets

## Manual Testing Checklist

  - Confirm other content is not accessible while tooltip is open
  - Test escape/back gesture closes tooltip properly

- [ ] **Content structure is logical**
  - Verify heading hierarchy makes sense
  - Confirm text flows in logical reading order
  - Test that all interactive elements are announced

### Reduced Motion Testing

#### Motion Preference Detection

  - Confirm tooltip borders and text are enhanced

- [ ] **Color-blind friendly**
  - Test with color blindness simulator
  - Verify help information doesn't rely solely on color
  - Confirm icons and text provide sufficient information

### Touch and Motor Accessibility

#### Touch Target Size
- [ ] **Minimum touch target requirements**
  - Measure help icon touch targets (should be ≥44x44pt)
  - Test with accessibility inspector
  - Verify adequate spacing between touch targets

#### Motor Impairment Support
- [ ] **Touch accuracy tolerance**
  - Test help tooltips with simulated motor impairments
  - Verify tooltips can be opened with imprecise touches
  - Confirm dismissal methods are accessible

### Cognitive Accessibility

#### Content Clarity
- [ ] **Language is clear and simple**
  - Review all help content for plain language
  - Verify explanations are concise and understandable
  - Confirm no jargon or complex terminology

- [ ] **Information hierarchy is logical**
  - Test that help topics progress logically
  - Verify most important information comes first
  - Confirm related concepts are grouped together

## Automated Testing

### Accessibility Testing Tools
```typescript
// Example accessibility tests (pseudo-code)
describe('Help Tooltip Accessibility', () => {
  it('should have accessible labels', () => {
    const helpIcon = getByRole('button', { name: /help/i });
    expect(helpIcon).toHaveAccessibilityLabel();
  });

  it('should support screen readers', () => {
    const helpTooltip = getByRole('dialog');
    expect(helpTooltip).toHaveAttribute('accessibilityViewIsModal', 'true');
  });

  it('should respect reduced motion', () => {
    // Mock reduced motion preference
    jest.spyOn(AccessibilityInfo, 'isReduceMotionEnabled')
      .mockResolvedValue(true);

    // Test that animations are simplified
    // Implementation depends on testing framework
  });
});
```

## Performance Testing with Accessibility

### Screen Reader Performance
- [ ] **VoiceOver performance**
  - Test tooltip opening speed with VoiceOver enabled
  - Verify no audio delays or stutters
  - Confirm smooth navigation between elements

- [ ] **Memory usage with accessibility**
  - Monitor memory usage with screen reader active
  - Verify no memory leaks during extended use
  - Test performance on older devices

## Browser/Device-Specific Testing

### iOS Testing
- [ ] **VoiceOver compatibility**
  - Test with VoiceOver on iPhone and iPad
  - Verify gesture support (swipe, double-tap, etc.)
  - Confirm compatibility across iOS versions

- [ ] **AssistiveTouch support**
  - Test with AssistiveTouch enabled
  - Verify all interactions are possible
  - Confirm custom gestures work

### Android Testing
- [ ] **TalkBack compatibility**
  - Test with TalkBack on various Android devices
  - Verify gesture navigation works correctly
  - Confirm speech output is clear

- [ ] **Switch Access support**
  - Test with Switch Access for motor impairments
  - Verify sequential navigation works
  - Confirm all actions are accessible via switches
